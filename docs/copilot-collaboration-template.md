## Key Interactions (3-5 entries)

### Setting up the project

**Mode:** Ask
**Why this mode:** Needed to clarify what issues were asking for and how to approach them
**Helpful:** Provided tips on how to create files and what to include in them

### Creating HTML structure

**Mode:** Agent
**Why this mode:** Referenced project.goals.md to create structure
**Helpful:** Generated HTML and CSS structures while referencing what I wanted to achieve in my goals

### Fixing CSS colors

**Mode:** Edit
**Why this mode:** Needed to change fonts, placement of poem
**Helpful:** Made it useful to change minor bits of code such as fonts and placements

## What I Learned

- **Ask vs Agent:** Use Ask to understand, Agent to build, Edit to fix
- **Best discovery:** It broke down the requirements and clarified what had to be completed. It also explained how to set up the .prettierrc file and the configurations. Ask was also useful for explaining a W3C error I received. 
- **Next time:** Use Ask more often to clarify requirements before starting to build.
