# Copilot Collaboration Log

## Quick Summary

- Which mode did you use most? [Ask]
- Most helpful Copilot moment: Clarifying issue requirements and explaining what needed to be done. 

## Key Interactions (3-5 entries)

### Setting up the project

**Mode:** Ask
**Why this mode:** Needed to clarify what issues were asking for and how to approach them.
**Helpful:** Provided tips on how to create files and what to include in them. Also explained topics I was stuck on when I ran into errors. Ask provided ideas for website names while still referring to the poem. 

### Creating HTML structure

**Mode:** Agent
**Why this mode:** Referenced project.goals.md to create structure
**Helpful:** Generated HTML and CSS structures while referencing what I wanted to achieve in my goals. Helped build the vision I was going for while referencing my project-goals.md file. 

### Fixing CSS colors

**Mode:** Edit
**Why this mode:** Needed to change fonts, placement of poem
**Helpful:** Made it useful to change minor bits of code such as fonts and placements. Changed the font design and background colors when asked multiple times. 

## What I Learned

- **Ask vs Agent:** Use Ask to understand, Agent to build
- **Best discovery:** It broke down the requirements and clarified what had to be completed. It also explained how to set up the .prettierrc file and the configurations. Ask was also useful for explaining a W3C error I received. Agent also edited code, realized it 
made a mistake, and then proceeded to fix the mistake after. 
- **Next time:** Use Ask more often to clarify requirements before starting to build. I personally felt that the Edit feature was not as useful as the Agent. Edit seemed to be slower than the Agent, but Edit also combed through the entire file.
