# Main Goals for the Poetry Website Project

1. Create a visually appealing and accessible poetry website that thoughtfully interprets and presents "The Soul selects her own Society" by Emily Dickinson.
2. Express the poem’s themes of individuality, choice, and quiet strength through a minimalist, "less is more" design aesthetic—using soft pastel blues/greens and gentle accent colors to evoke a contemplative, somber mood.
3. Use only semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3 (no JavaScript), prioritizing clean structure and meaningful markup to mirror the poem’s clarity and order.
4. Ensure a mobile-first, responsive design so the poem and site content are easy to read and navigate on any device.
5. Meet or exceed WCAG AA accessibility standards, with careful attention to color contrast, heading hierarchy, and screen reader support.
6. Present the poem with clear, readable typography—choosing classic, literary fonts and generous spacing to give each stanza and line room to breathe, reflecting the poem’s introspective nature.
7. Incorporate personal reflections and design choices that connect the site’s look and feel to your own interpretation of the poem’s message about self-selection and societal boundaries.
8. Deploy the finished site to Netlify for public access, ensuring fast load times and professional presentation.
9. Document the design and coding process, including key decisions, challenges, and how AI collaboration contributed to the project.

# Project Goals: Poetry Interpretation

## Overview

- **Project Type:** Poetry interpretation website for Web Dev II
- **Target Audience:** Instructors, peers, and potential employers evaluating web development skills
- **Timeline:** TBD

## Learning Goals

I want to create a website that will demonstrate the ambiance of "The Soul selects her own Society" by Emily Dickinson. I want the website to follow a somber mood board while following WCAG AA standards.
I also do not want the website to be cluttered, but also have some features that enhance the experience while visiting the website. I want to learn how to incorporate the use of AI while building the structure, while also learning how to advance my own personal skill set. I want the website to follow a minimalist/introspective theme, while also being professional and following best accessibility guidelines.

## Professional Tooling Setup

- Use Prettier to ensure code is consistent and properly formatted
- Use Github Copilot's different modes, including Ask, Agent, and Edit
- Keep project files organized and up to date
- Update documentation regarding experiences with Copilot's different modes and progress
- Follow WCAG AA accessibility standards

## Technical Constraints

- HTML5 and CSS3 only (no JavaScript)
- Must be responsive (mobile-first approach)
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Deploy to Netlify

## Semantic HTML Structure

### Planned Page Structure

- `<header>` - Site title and navigation
- `<main>` - Primary content container
  - `<section>` - Poem presentation area
    - `<article>` - The actual poem text with proper stanza structure
  - `<section>` - Personal interpretation and reflection
  - `<aside>` - Additional context or author information (if needed)
- `<footer>` - Copyright and deployment information

### Accessibility-First Markup

- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3) for screen readers
- `<blockquote>` for poem citation with proper attribution
- Semantic list elements for stanzas or key points
- `alt` attributes for any decorative elements
- `lang` attribute for proper language identification
- Skip links for keyboard navigation

### Content Organization

- Logical reading order that flows naturally
- Clear section breaks between poem and interpretation
- Meaningful link text and button labels
- Form labels properly associated (if contact elements are added)
- Focus indicators for keyboard users
