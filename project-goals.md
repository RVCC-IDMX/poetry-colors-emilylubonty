# Main Goals for the Poetry Website Project

1. Create a visually appealing and accessible poetry website that thoughtfully interprets and presents "The Soul selects her own Society" by Emily Dickinson.
2. Express the poem’s themes of individuality, choice, and quiet strength through a minimalist, "less is more" design aesthetic—using soft pastel blues/greens and gentle accent colors to evoke a contemplative, somber mood.
3. Use only semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3 (no JavaScript), prioritizing clean structure and meaningful markup to mirror the poem’s clarity and order.
4. Ensure a mobile-first, responsive design so the poem and site content are easy to read and navigate on any device.
5. Meet or exceed WCAG AA accessibility standards, with careful attention to color contrast, heading hierarchy, and screen reader support.
6. Present the poem with clear, readable typography—choosing classic, literary fonts and generous spacing to give each stanza and line room to breathe, reflecting the poem’s introspective nature.
7. Incorporate personal reflections and design choices that connect the site’s look and feel to your own interpretation of the poem’s message about self-selection and societal boundaries.
8. Deploy the finished site to Netlify for public access, ensuring fast load times and professional presentation.
9. Document the design and coding process, including key decisions, challenges, and how AI collaboration contributed to the project.

# Project Goals: Poetry Interpretation

## Learning Goals

I want to create a website that will demonstrate the ambiance of "The Soul selects her own Society" by Emily Dickinson. I want the website to follow a somber mood board while following WCAG AA standards.
I also do not want the website to be cluttered, but also have some features that enhance the experience while visiting the website. I want to learn how to incorporate the use of AI while building the structure, while also learning how to advance my own personal skill set. I want the website to follow a minimalist/introspective theme, while also being professional and following best accessibility guidelines.
